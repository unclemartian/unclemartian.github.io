# Balancer LBP

A __Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool__ is a tool designed to allow a project to generate liquidity from a smaller amount of seed capital than would normally be required. 

This is achieved through variable weighting of assets.

## price adjustment

The liquidity guide pool also provides the project party with the ability to quickly adjust the weight, which can reduce the value of the tokens in the pool by adjusting the proportion of reserve assets, and prevent the eventual price surge due to early speculation. 

Under such a design mechanism, the opening price is usually deliberately set higher, and the lower price may appear in the later stage of the event.

So the users who want to participate in LBP need to pay attention to this risk, and when the project is popular enough, this risk will be reduced.

## advantages

1. The price is relatively stable, not easy to lose control
2. Reduce the “front-running” of advanced trading bots and experts.
3. Some projects can support multiple tokens to participate in exchange
