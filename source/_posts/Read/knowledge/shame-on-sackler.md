# Sackler family

Members of the Sackler family own Purdue Pharma, the company that manufactures the __prescription painkiller OxyContin__ (went on market in 1995). 

According to the [American Society of Addiction Medicine](https://www.asam.org/docs/default-source/advocacy/opioid-addiction-disease-facts-figures.pdf), more than 20,000 overdose deaths in 2015 related to prescription pain relievers. 

According to [another report in 2016 from CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm655051e1.htm), 115 per day die from an opioid overdose. (相当于一年4万人)

## 阿片类药物

2007年，普渡制药公司及其3名高管就因对奥施康定过度宣传而被罚款6.35亿美元

2017年10月，时任__美国总统特朗普__宣布，因阿片类药物上瘾和滥用危机严重，美国正式进入__全国公共卫生紧急状态__。

# "Shame on Sackler" in MET

A protest held in March 2018 at MET’s __Sackler Wing__, organized by members of the collective __PAIN Sackler__ (whose acronym stands for Prescription Addiction Intervention Now)

Demonstrators gathered at the __Temple of Dendur, the Ancient Egyptian structure housed__ in the Sackler Wing

## Leader

Nan Goldin, an ex OxyContin addict.

## Aftermath

Representatives for Jillian Sackler, the widow of Arthur M. Sackler, sent statement 3/12/2018:

> Much of what’s been written in recent months about my late husband, Dr. Arthur M. Sackler, is utterly false. Arthur died nearly a decade before Purdue Pharma – owned by the families of Mortimer and Raymond Sackler (his brothers) — developed and marketed OxyContin. At the time of his death in 1987, Arthur was lauded for his contributions to medical research, medical communications and museums. He was a renowned art collector and connoisseur, and because of this, we have the Arthur M. Sacker Gallery of Chinese Stone Sculpture at The Met, the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery at the Smithsonian, the Arthur M. Sackler Museum at Harvard, the Jillian and Arthur M. Sackler Wing of Galleries at the Royal Academy and the Arthur M. Sackler Museum of Art and Archaeology and the Jillian Sackler Sculpture Garden at Peking University. None of the charitable donations made by Arthur prior to his death, nor that I made on his behalf after his death, were funded by the production, distribution or sale of OxyContin or other revenue from Purdue Pharma. Period.
>
> Further, as a physician and medical scientist, Arthur was moved by a curiosity and desire to improve lives with new therapies. He made a substantial part of his fortune over 50 years in medical research, medical advertising and trade publications. His philanthropy in medicine extended to the Arthur M. Sackler Center for Health Communications at Tufts University and the Arthur M. Sackler Sciences Center at Clark University.
>
> All these gifts, made in the 1970s and 80s, were made independently of his brothers and their families. Thus, for anyone to assert that institutions received “tainted” gifts from Arthur is ludicrous.
>
> Passing judgment on Arthur’s life’s work through the lens of the opioid crisis some 30 years after his death is a gross injustice. It denies the many important contributions he made working to improve world health and to build cultural bridges between peoples.

## MET response

Metropolitan Museum of Art removed the Sackler name from 7 spaces in Dec. 2021. 

特别是 the wing that houses the __Dendur Temple__

> "The Met is a bellwether," Patrick Radden Keefe, who wrote a book on the Sacklers and the opioid crisis, told the New York Times. "It is in some ways the institution that is most linked with the Sacklers in the public mind because the Sackler Wing is so iconic and because it was one of the early recipients of their very significant philanthropy. Institutions have been kind of watching the Met."

## "Shame on Sackler" in Guggenheim

In Feb 2019, demonstrators staged a “die in” and dropped thousands of paper slips designed to look like of OxyContin prescriptions, to protest the facility’s ties to the billionaire Sackler family.

> die-in
> 
> a type of protest in which a group of people lie down in a public place as if they are dead and refuse to leave or allow normal activities to continue there

## Aftermath

The Guggenheim stopped accepting donations from the Sacklers in March 2019.

之后的3年时间里： __Lourve__, Serpentine North Gallery (once the Serpentine Sackler Gallery), the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Tate, and London's National Portrait Gallery 分别移除了 Sacklers 的名字。 

> The British Museum ended its 30-year relationship with the family in March 2022. 据称，Sackler家族对大英博物馆的支持已超过 30 年，在20世纪90年代至 2013 年期间对大英博物馆提供了多次捐赠。赛克勒的名字将继续保留在博物馆大中庭（Great Court）的捐赠者名单上，因为博物馆“始终认为我们的每一位捐赠者都是我们重要的伙伴。”

The Sacklers were honored as the namesakes of __the institution’s Center for Arts Education__ till it's quietly erased in early May 2022.

Guggenheim is __the last museum__ to drop Sackler name.
