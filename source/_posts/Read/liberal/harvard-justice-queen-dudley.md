# Queen v. Dudley and Stephens

Known as __the case of cannibalism at sea__ (a 19th century British law case).

Dudley describes their rescue in his diary with staggering euphemism, quote:

> "on the twenty fourth day as we were having our breakfast a ship appeared at last."
>
> The three survivors were picked up by a German ship. They were taken back to Falmouth in England where they were arrested and tried.

> They claimed they had acted out of necessity.
>
> they argued in effect better that one should die so that three could survive

## Discussion

### 1. Asking for Consent

    If the 17-year-old __Richard Parker__ were asked consent, would it be morally justifiable?

    Otherwise, it's a __coerced consent__. 

    What if Richard volunteers?

### 2. Lottery

    Lack of __fair procedure__.

    What about the lottery idea? Would it make a moral difference?

    Maybe what bothers you is not the cannibalism, but __the lack of due process__.

### 3. Categorically wrong

    Murder is murder. 

    > In fact the London newspaper at the time and popular opinion sympathized with Dudley in Stephens.
    >
    > The paper said, "If they weren't motivated by affection and concern for their loved ones and dependents, surely they wouldn't have done this."
