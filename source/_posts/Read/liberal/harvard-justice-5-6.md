# 功利主义的争议

## Mill认为

We can use utilitarian framework to distinguish between higher and lower pleasures, it is possible to make qualitative distinctions of worth.

同时：

Justice is the most sacred and the most incomparably binding part of morality.

Because society as a whole will be better off in the long-run.

## Dilemma 1

有时候，偏好和 higher or worthier pleasure 并不能完美匹配。

eg. reading Shakespares

## Dilemma 2

为什么 justice 是最重要的？功利主义是尊重人的价值的唯一理由吗？

eg. 医生不取活人的器官，是因为长期对社会风气有害（大家不爱去看病），还是因为道德的本质约束？

# Strong theories of rights

认为：Individuals matter not just as instruments to be used for a larger social purpose，or __for the sake of maximizing utility__.

主张：Individuals are separate beings with separate lives worthy of respect.

## Libertarianism 

The fundamental individual right is __the right to liberty__.

That means:

1. a right to choose freely &
1. to live our lives as we please，
1. provided we respect other people's rights.

# Robert Nozick

(according to libertarian theory), 提出

1. No __Paternalist（家长主义者） legislation__

    国家无权立法强制公民做事，除非公民通过立法程序进行了选择。
    
    (eg. passing laws that protect people from themselves, like wearning a helmet)

1. No __Morals legislation__

    不能以立法形式，以促进道德名义来侵犯个人自由。

    (eg. prevent sexual intimacy between gay and lesbians)

1. No __Redistribution of wealth__ from rich to poor

政府职能只限于提供优先的公共服务, like national defense and 。

## Nozick反对财富再分配

Nozick: What makes income distribution just?

1. __Justice in Acquisition__ (initial holdings) 正当竞争：原始积累方式是否正当

2. __Justice in Transfer__ (free market) 

Thus：__taxation__ = taking of earnings = __forced labor = slavery__

（Violates principle of self-possession）

## Nozick的观点反对者

Objections to libertarian:

1. The poor need the money more.
1. Taxation by consent of the governed is not co-erced.
1. The wealthy people own a debt to society.
1. Wealth depends partly on luck or other factors.

### Discussion 

The fundamental premise of __self-possession__ is discounted, because everyone living in a society. 

Thus we don't purely own ourselves. 因为你生活在人群社会中。

Is the fundamental __right to religious liberty__ different from the __right
to private property__? 

Maybe 因为religious是私人的，但是财产是社会共同创造的。

## Nozick Quote

From each as they choose, to each as they are chosen. 

—— Nozick 

（任尔选择，给尔所选。选择的后果自负）

# 总结

自由派主张 __avoid a society__ and with account of Justice where some people can be used for the sake of common welfare.  

We should resort to the intuitively powerful idea that: __we are the proprietors of our own person__.
