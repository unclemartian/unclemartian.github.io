# Jeremy Bentham 边沁

杰里米·边沁（1748年2月15日-1832年6月6日）。

现代功利主义 Utilitarianism 的创始人。

1. Born in England 1748
1. 12 years old, went to Oxford
1. 15 years old, went to law school

Bentham never practiced law, instead he devoted his life to __jurisprudence and moral philosophy__.

Bentham 的尸体目前放在 University College London。

UCL 董事会他也会以 “present not voting” 名义参加。

## Theory

The right thing to do is to maximize utility. 

> Utility = Balance of __Pleasure__ over __Pain__, __Happiness__ over __Suffering__.

## Slogan

__The greatest good for the greatest number.__

# John Stuart Mill 穆勒

Born in 1805. 他的父亲 James Mill 是Bentham的 disciple (弟子)。

20岁之前博学多才，20-25岁精神崩溃。后来恢复正常。

## Study and View

Utilitarian calculus could be enlarged and modified to

accommodate humanitatian concerns like 

the concept to __respect individual rights__, and 

to address the distinction between __higher and lower pleasures__.

他认为，所有人类的体验都可以量化，但某些快乐是更值得拥有，更有价值的。

Bentham thinks that there are no natural rights, whereas Mill thinks that utilitarian moral theory supports the idea that we should recognize individual rights.

# Higher Vs. Lower Pleasure 人的喜好是否有高低贵贱

Mill 认为：

Higher pleasure requires cultivation (开垦，耕作), appreciation, and education. 

But once cultivated, it is possible to distinguish higher pleasures from lower ones. If you have tried both of them, you will prefer the higher ones naturally.

## Bentham Quote

The quantity of pleasure being equal, pushpin is as good as poetry. 

– Jeremy Bentham

## John Stuart Mill Quote 1

The sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable is that people actually do desire it. 

– John Stuart Mill

## John Stuart Mill Quote 2

关于 爱好的高贵与低贱：

“It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied. Better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool or the pig are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their side of the question.”

– John Stuart Mill
