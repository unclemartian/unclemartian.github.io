# Jeremy Bentham

1. Born in England 1748
1. 12 years old, went to Oxford
1. 15 years old, went to law school
1. 19 years old, admitted to the bar

Bentham never practiced law, instead he devoted his life to __jurisprudence and moral philosophy__.

## Theory

The right thing to do is to maximize utility. (Utility = Balance of pleasure over Pain, Happiness over Suffering.)

## Slogan

The greatest good for the greatest number

# Queen v. Dudley and Stephens

Known as __the case of cannibalism at sea__ (a 19th century British law case).

Dudley describes their rescue in his diary with staggering euphemism, quote:

> "on the twenty fourth day as we were having our breakfast a ship appeared at last."
>
> The three survivors were picked up by a German ship. They were taken back to Falmouth in England where they were arrested and tried.

> They claimed they had acted out of necessity.
>
> they argued in effect better that one should die so that three could survive

## Discussion

1. __Asking for Consent__

    If the 17-year-old Richard Parker were asked consent, would it be morally justifiable?

    Otherwise, it's a __coerced consent__. 

    What if Richard volunteers?

2. __Lottery__

    Lack of fair procedure.

    What about the lottery idea? Would it make a moral difference?

    Maybe what bothers you is not the cannibalism, but __the lack of due process__.

3. __Categorically wrong__

    Murder is murder. 

    > In fact the London newspaper at the time and popular opinion sympathized with Dudley in Stephens.
    >
    > The paper said, "If they weren't motivated by affection and concern for their loved ones and dependents, surely they wouldn't have done this."

# Utilitarianism

The highest principle of morality (whether personal or political morality)

is to maximize the __general welfare__ or the __collective happiness__

or the overall balance of __pleasure over pain__

in a phrase maximize utility.
