# Methodology 

Look at Modern Art __by theme__, instead of by __time period, or by movement__. 

1. Places and spaces
2. Art identity
3. Transforming everyday objects
4. Art & society

## Constructivism (learning)

It's a philosophy of education about [nature of knowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism), that focuses on how humans make meaning from their experiences. 

> All of us constantly organize and select the information our senses take in from the natural world and from the symbolic and cultural worlds of words and signs. This is how we make sense of these worlds. This activity is independent of any particular educational theory. It’s a consequence of our being human, of our neurological system and the way it develops and interacts with the environment.

> Children are not born with the ability to interpret the world as their elders do. They have to learn the meaning of things and they do so gradually, as they gain experience. 

Hein, G. (1999). "Is Meaning Making Constructivism? Is Constructivism Meaning Making? [The Exhibitionist, 18(2) 15-18.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/mairesources2015/Module%201%20Readings/Hein_isMeaningMaking.pdf)

# What is Modern Art

1860 - 1945 (or some say 1970)

## Birth

Can be traced back to the __Industrial Revolution__ (from 18th to the 19th century)

> rapid changes in __manufacturing, transportation, and technology__ profoundly affected the __social, economic, and cultural conditions of life__ in Western Europe, North America, and eventually the world. 

## Contrast

Before: 

1. artists were often commissioned to make artwork by wealthy patrons, or institutions like __the church__

1. depicted __religious__ or mythological scenes (intended to __instruct the viewer__)

After:

1. make art about people, places, or ideas that interested them, and of which they __had direct experience__

1. exploring dreams, symbolism, and personal iconography (肖像学) as avenues for the depiction of their __subjective(主观的) experiences__.

1. expressive use of color, non-traditional materials, and new techniques and mediums (as oppose to realistically depict the world), eg. photography

## Conclude

With [these factors](http://wendistry.com/contemporary-vs-modern-whats-the-difference/): 

1. felt free to __trust their inner visions__
1. __express those visions__ in their work
1. use __real life__ (social issues and images from modern life) as a source of subject matter
1. experiment and innovate with __different subject matters and mediums__ as often as possible

> 1970s is the last bastion of __easily classified artistic movements__. 

> Though hard to classify emergent movements, Contemporary Art, collectively, is much more socially, economically, and politically conscious.
