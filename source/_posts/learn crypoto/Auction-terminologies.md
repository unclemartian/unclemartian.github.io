# absentee bid

竞买委托

拍卖人应竞买人的要求，为其提供的代为传递竞买信息的服务。（注：代为传递竞买信息的服务通常包括现场举牌竞价、电话委托竞价、网络竞价等）

You can bid on an item at an auction even if you are not able to be there yourself by placing an absentee bid. An absentee bidder places their bid with the auctioneer prior to the beginning of the auction. These offers can be submitted in written or verbal form, depending on the terms set by the auction house. It is important to understand how absentee bidding works before using this method to buy items at an auction.
