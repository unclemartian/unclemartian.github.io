## Crypto Payment vs. Correspondent Bank

1. Shorter settlement period
1. Lower cost

However,

1. Volatility of value
1. Fiat onramp and offramp
1. Complicated UX
1. Only have regional unicorns (bcuz offramp and BD to enroll users is a highly localized task)

## Alternatives Payment Types

1. Peer-to-peer marketplace -> on/offramp network
1. Big band gift cards -> stablecoins

New start-ups (non-crypto) including m-Pesa, Transferwise, Paypal and Veem.
