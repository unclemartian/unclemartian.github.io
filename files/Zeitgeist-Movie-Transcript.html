                            <FONT color=#ffffff>This is the sun. As far back as 10
                                thousand B.C.E., history is abundant with carvings <A onfocus=this.blur() onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'Stars','500','400','yes','center');return false" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com/Dowth1.htm">[M]</A> and writings
                                reflecting people's respect and adoration for this object <A href="#S1">[S1]</A>. And it is simple to understand why as every morning
                                the sun would rise, bringing vision, warmth, and security, saving man from
                                the cold, blind, predator-filled darkness of night. Without it, the
                                cultures understood, the crops would not grow, and life on the planet
                                would not survive. These realities made the sun the most adored object of
                                all time.<A onfocus=this.blur() onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'Stars','500','400','yes','center');return false" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com/zodiac_hall.htm">[M]</A> Likewise,
                                they were also very aware of the stars.<A onfocus=this.blur() onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'Stars','500','400','yes','center');return false" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com/Stars1.htm">[M]</A> The tracking of
                                the stars allowed them to recognize and anticipate events which occurred
                                over long periods of time, such as eclipses and full moons.<A onfocus=this.blur() onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'Stars','500','400','yes','center');return false" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com/Krupp.htm">[M]</A> They in turn

                        </P>
                        <P align=left>This is the cross of the Zodiac, one of the oldest

                            the sun as it figuratively passes through the 12 major constellations over
                            the course of a year. It also reflects the 12 months of the year, the 4
                            seasons, and the solstices and equinoxes <FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S3">[S3]</A></FONT> . The term Zodiac relates to the fact that
                            constellations were anthropomorphized, or personified, as figures, or
                            animals.<FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S4">[S4]</A> <A onfocus=this.blur() onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'Stars','500','400','yes','center');return false" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com/hall2.htm">[M]</A> </FONT>

                            the sun and stars, they personified them with elaborate myths involving

                            places of travel for God's Sun and were identified by names, usually
                            representing elements of nature that happened during that period of time.

                            ancient hieroglyphics in Egypt, we know much about this solar messiah. For

                            speaking, every morning Horus would win the battle against Set - while in
                            the evening, Set would conquer Horus and send him into the

                            "dark vs. light" or "good vs. evil" is one of the most ubiquitous

                        <P align=left>There is another very interesting phenomenon that occurs
                            around December 25th, or the winter solstice. From the summer solstice to
                            the winter solstice, the days become shorter and colder. From the
                            perspective of the northern hemisphere, the sun appears to move south and
                            get smaller and more scarce. The shortening of the days and the expiration
                            of the crops when approaching the winter solstice symbolized the process
                            of death to the ancients<FONT color=#ffffff>. </FONT>It was the death of
                            the Sun. <FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S73">[S73]</A></FONT> By December
                            22nd, the Sun's demise was fully realized, for the Sun, having moved south
                            continually for 6 months, makes it to it's lowest point in the sky. Here a
                            curious thing occurs: the Sun stops moving south, at least perceivably,
                            for 3 days.<FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S74">[S74]</A></FONT>

                        <P align=left>Now, of the many astrological-astronomical metaphors in the
                            Bible, one of the most important has to do with the ages. Throughout the
                            scripture there are numerous references to the "Age." In order to
                            understand this, we need to be familiar with the phenomenon known as the
                            precession of the equinoxes. The ancient Egyptians along with cultures
                            long before them recognized that approximately every 2150 <FONT color=#ffffff><A onfocus=this.blur() onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'Stars','500','400','yes','center');return false" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com/pre.htm">[D]</A></FONT> years the
                            sunrise on the morning of the spring equinox would occur at a different
                            sign of the Zodiac. <FONT color=#ffffff><A onfocus=this.blur() onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'Stars','500','400','yes','center');return false" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com/pre2.htm">[M]</A></FONT> This has to
                            do with a slow angular wobble that the Earth maintains as it rotates on
                            it's axis.It is called a precession because the constellations go
                            backwards, rather than through the normal yearly cycle. <FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S101">[S101]</A> </FONT>The amount of time that it
                            takes for the precession to go through all 12 signs is roughly 25,765
                            years. <FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S102">[S102]</A> </FONT>This is also
                            called the "Great Year," <FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S103">[S103]</A></FONT> and ancient societies were very aware of
                            this. They referred to each 2150 year period as an "age." From 4300 b.c.
                            to 2150 b.c., it was the Age of Taurus, the Bull. From 2150 b.c. to 1
                            a.d., it was the Age of Aries, the Ram, and from 1 a.d. to 2150 a.d. it is
                            the Age of Pisces, the age we are still in to this day, and in and around
                            2150, we will enter the new age: the Age of Aquarius. <FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S104">[S104]</A> <A href="#S105">[S105]</A>

                        <P align=left>Now, the Bible reflects, broadly speaking, a symbolic
                            movement through 3 ages, while foreshadowing a 4th. In the Old Testament
                            when Moses comes down Mount Sinai with the 10 Commandments, he is very
                            upset to see his people worshiping a golden bull calf.<FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S106">[S106]</A> </FONT>In fact, he shattered the
                            stone tablets and instructed his people to kill each other in order to
                            purify themselves. <FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S107">[S107</A></FONT>]
                            Most Biblical scholars would attribute this anger to the fact that the
                            Israelites were worshiping a false idol, <FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S108">[S108</A></FONT>] or something to that effect. The reality is
                            that the golden bull is Taurus the Bull, and Moses represents the new Age
                            of Aries the Ram. <FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S109">[S109]</A></FONT>

                            represents the new Age of Aries, <FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S111">[S111]</A></FONT> and upon the new age, everyone must shed
                            the old age. Other deities mark these transitions as well, a pre-Christian
                            god who kills the bull, in the same symbology. <FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S112">[S112]</A> <A href="#S113">[S113]</A> <A onfocus=this.blur() onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'Stars','500','400','yes','center');return false" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com/bull.htm">[M]</A> </FONT>

                            symbolism is very abundant in the New Testament. Jesus feeds 5000 people

                        <P align=left>At Luke 22:10 when Jesus is asked by his disciples where the
                            next passover will be, Jesus replied: "Behold, when ye are entered into
                            the city, there shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water... follow
                            him into the house where he entereth in." This scripture is by far one of
                            the most revealing of all the astrological references. The man bearing a
                            pitcher of water is Aquarius, the water-bearer, who is always pictured as
                            a man pouring out a pitcher of water. <FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S119">[S119]</A></FONT> He represents the age after Pisces, and
                            when the Sun (God's Sun) leaves the Age of Pisces (Jesus), it will go into
                            the House of Aquarius, as Aquarius follows Pisces in the precession of the
                            equinoxes. Also Jesus is saying is that after the Age of Pisces will come
                            the Age of Aquarius. <FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S120">[S120]</A></FONT>

                        <P align=left>Now, we have all heard about the end times and the end of
                            the world. Apart from the cartoonish depictions in the Book of Revelation,
                            the main source of this idea comes from Matthew 28:20, where Jesus says "I
                            will be with you even to the end of the world." <FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S121">[S121]</A></FONT> However, in King James Version, "world" is
                            a mistranslation, among many mistranslations. The actual word being used
                            is "aeon", which means "age." "I will be with you even to the end of the
                            age." Which is true, as Jesus' Solar Piscean personification will end when
                            the Sun enters the Age of Aquarius. <FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S122">[S122]</A></FONT> The entire concept of end times and the end

                        <P align=left>Justin Martyr, one of the first Christian historians and
                            defenders, wrote: "When we say that he, Jesus Christ, our teacher, was
                            produced without sexual union, was crucified and died, and rose again, and
                            ascended into Heaven, we propound nothing different from what you believe

                            obvious that Justin and other early Christians knew how similar
                            Christianity was to the Pagan religions. However, Justin had a solution.
                            As far as he was concerned, the Devil did it. The Devil had the foresight
                            to come before Christ, and create these characteristics in the Pagan
                            world. <FONT color=#ffffff><A href="#S169">[S169]</A></FONT>

                            authority. It reduces human responsibility to the effect that "God"
                            controls everything, and in turn awful crimes can be justified in the name
                            of Divine Pursuit. And most importantly, it empowers those who know the
                            truth but use the myth to manipulate and control societies. The religious
                            myth is the most powerful device ever created, and serves as the
                            psychological soil upon which other myths can flourish</P>

                            prime cause that King George III of England outlawed the interest-free
                            independent currency the colonies were producing and using for themselves.
                            In turn forcing them to borrow money from the Central Bank of England, at
                            interest, he immediately put the colonies in the debt. And as Benjamin

                        <P>In 1783 America won its independence from England. However, its battle
                            against the Central Bank concept and the corrupt, greed filled men
                            associated with it had just begun.</P>
                        <P>So what is a central bank? A central bank is an institution that
                            produces the currency of an entire nation. Based on historical precedent,
                            two specific powers are inherent in central banking practice: the control
                            of interest rates and the control of the money supply, or inflation. The
                            central bank does not simply supply a government's economy with money, it
                            loans it to them at interest. Then through the use of increasing and
                            decreasing of supply of money the central bank regulates the value of the
                            currency being issued. It is critical to understand that the entire
                            structure of this system can only produce one thing in the long run:
                            DEBT.</P>
                        <P>It doesn't take a lot of ingenuity to figure their scam now. For, every
                            single dollar produced by the central bank is loaned at interest. That
                            means every single dollar produced is actually the dollar plus a certain
                            percent of debt based on that dollar. And since the central bank has the
                            monopoly of the production of the currency for the entire country and they
                            loan each dollar out with an immediate debt attached to it, where does the
                            money that pay for the debt come from? It can only come from the central
                            bank again. Which means the central bank has to perpetually increase its
                            money supply to temporarily cover the outstanding debt created which in
                            turn, since that new money is loaned out at interest as well creates even
                            more debt? The end result of this system without fail is slavery for it is
                            impossible for the government, and thus the public, to ever come out of
                            the self-generating debt. The founding fathers of this country were well
                            aware of this.</P>

                        <P>By the early 20th century the US have already implemented and removed a
                            few central banking systems, which were swindled into place by the
                            ruthless banking interests. At this time, the dominate families in the
                            banking and business world were: J.D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, Paul
                            Warburg, Baron Rothschild. And in they early 1900's they sought to push
                            once again legislation to create another central bank. However, they knew
                            the Government and public were very wary of such an institution. So they
                            needed to create an incident to affect the public opinion. So J.P.Morgan,
                            publicly considered a financial luminary at the time, exploited his mass
                            influence by publishing rumours about a prominent bank in New York wasn't
                            solvent or bankrupt. Morgan new this would cause mass hysteria which would
                            affect other banks as well. And it did. The public in fear of losing their
                            deposits immediately began mass withdrawals. Consequently, the banks were
                            forced to call in their loans causing their recipients to sell their
                            property and thus the spiral of bankruptcies, repossessions and turmoil
                            emerged. Putting the pieces together a few years later, Fredrik Allen of
                            Life Magazine wrote:</P>
                        <P>�The Morgan interests took advantage� to participate the panic [of
                            1907] guiding it shrewdly as it progressed� �Frederik Allen, Life
                            Magazine</P>
                        <P>Unaware of the fraud, the panic of 1907 led to the Congressional
                            investigation headed by Senator Nelson Aldrich, who had intimate ties to
                            the banking cartels and later became part of the Rockefeller family
                            through marriage. The commission led by Aldrich recommended a central bank
                            should be implemented so a panic like 1907 could never happen again. This
                            was the spark that international bankers needed to initiate their
                            plan.</P>
                        <P>In 1910 a secret meeting was held at the J.P.Morgan's estate on Jekyll
                            Island off the coast of Georgia. It was there that the central banking
                            bill called the Federal Reserve Act was written. This legislation was
                            written by bankers, not law makers. This meeting was so secretive, so
                            concealed from Government and public knowledge that a 10 or so figures who
                            intended disguised their names when on route to the island. After this
                            bill was constructed, it was then handed over to their political front
                            man, Senator Nelson Aldrich, to push through Congress. And in 1913, with
                            heavy political sponsorship by the bankers, Woodrow Wilson became
                            president, having already agreed to sign the Federal Reserve Act in
                            exchange for campaign support. And two days before Christmas, when most of
                            Congress was at home with their families, the Federal Reserve Act was
                            voted in and Wilson in turn made it law. Years later Woodrow Wilson wrote,
                            in regret:</P>
                        <P>�[Our] Great Industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit.
                            Our system of credit is privately concentrated. The growth of the nation,
                            therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men.. who
                            necessarily, by very reason of their own limitations, chill and check and
                            destroy genuine economic freedom.�</P>
                        <P>�We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely
                            controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world �no government
                            by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the
                            majority, but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups
                            of dominant men.�<BR>-Woodrow Wilson</P>
                        <P>Congressman Louis McFadden also expressed the truth after the passage
                            of the bill:</P>
                        <P>�A world banking system was being set up here� a superstate controlled
                            by international bankers.. acting together to enslave the world for their
                            own pleasure. The FED has usurped the government.�</P>
                        <P>Now, the public was told that the Federal Reserve System was economic
                            stabilizer and inflation and economic crises were thing of the past. Well,
                            as history has shown, nothing was further from the truth. The fact is, the
                            international bankers now had a streamline machine to expand their
                            personal ambitions.</P>
                        <P>For example, from 1914 to 1919 the Fed increased the money supply by
                            nearly 100% resulting in extensive loans to small banks and the public.
                            Then, in 1920 the Fed called in mass percentages of the outstanding money
                            supply. Thus resulting in the supporting banks having to call in huge
                            numbers of loans and just like 1907, bank runs, bankruptcy and collapse
                            occurred. Over 5.400 competitive banks outside of the Federal Reserve
                            System collapsed further consolidating the monopoly of the small group of
                            international bankers. Privy to this crime, Congressman Lindbergh stepped
                            up and said in 1921:</P>
                        <P>�Under the Federal Reserve Act, panics are scientifically created. The
                            present panic is the first scientifically created one, worked out as we
                            figure a mathematical equation.� �Charles Lindbergh</P>
                        <P>However, the panic of 1920 was just a warm-up. From 1921 to 1929 the
                            Fed again increased the money supply resulting once again in extensive
                            loans to the public and banks. There was also a fairly new type of loan
                            called the margin loan in the stock market. Very simply, the margin loan
                            allowed an investor to put down only 10% of the stock's price with the
                            other 90% being loaned from the broker. In other words, a person could own
                            a $1000 worth of stock, with only a $100 down. This method was very
                            popular in the roaring 1920's as everyone seemed to be making money in the
                            market. However, there was a catch to this loan. It could be called in at
                            any time and had to be paid within 24 hours. This is termed "a margin
                            call", and a typical result of a margin call was the selling of the stock
                            purchased with the loan.</P>
                        <P>So, a few months before October in 1929, J.D.Rockefeller, Bernard
                            Baruch and other insiders quietly exited the market. And on October 24th,
                            1929 the New York financiers who furnished the margin loans started
                            calling them in, in mass. This sparked an instantaneous massive sell off
                            in the market for everyone who had to cover the margin loans. It then
                            triggered a mass bank runs for the same reason, in turn collapsing over
                            16.000 banks enabling the conspiring international bankers to not only buy
                            up rival banks at the discount but to also buy up whole corporations at
                            pennies on the dollar. It was the greatest robbery in American
                            history.</P>
                        <P>But that didn't stop there. Rather then expanding the money supply
                            which were recovered from this economic collapse the Fed actually
                            contracted it, fuelling one of the largest depressions in history. Once
                            again outraged, Congressman Louis McFadden, a long time opponent of the
                            banking cartels began bringing impeachment proceedings against the Federal
                            Reserve Board. Saying of the crash and depression:</P>
                        <P>�It was a carefully contrived occurrence, international bankers sought
                            to bring about a condition of despair, so that they might emerge the
                            rulers of us all.� -Louis McFadden</P>
                        <P>Not surprisingly, and after two previous assassination attempts,
                            McFadden was poisoned at a banquet before he could push for the
                            impeachment.</P>
                        <P>Now, having reduced the society of the squaller the Federal Reserve
                            bankers decided that the gold standard should be removed. In order to do
                            this, they needed to acquire the remaining gold in the system. So, under
                            the pretense of "helping to end the depression", came the 1933 gold
                            seizure. Under the threat of imprisonment for 10 years everyone in America
                            was required to turn in all gold bullion to the Treasury, essentially
                            robbing the public of what little wealth they had left. And at the end of
                            1933 the gold standard was abolished. If you look at a dollar bill from
                            before 1933 it says it is redeemable in gold. You look at the dollar bill
                            today, it says it is legal tender which means it is backed by absolutely
                            nothing. It is worthless paper. The only thing that gives our money value
                            is how much of it is in circulation. Therefore, the power to regulate the
                            money supply is also the power to regulate its value which is also the
                            power to bring entire economies and societies to its knees.</P>

                        <P>It's important to clearly understand, the Federal Reserve is a private
                            corporation. It is about as "federal" as Federal Express. It makes its own
                            policies and is under virtually no regulation by the US Government. It is
                            a private bank that loans all the currency at interest to the Government,
                            completely consistent with the fraudulent central banking model that the
                            country sought to escape from when it declared independence in the
                            American revolutionary war. Now, going back to 1913 the Federal Reserve
                            Act was not the only unconstitutional bill pushed through Congress. They
                            also pushed the Federal Income Tax. It's worthwhile to point out that the
                            American public's ignorance towards the Federal Income Tax is a testament
                            to how dumbed down and oblivious the American population really is.</P>
                        <P>First of all the Federal Income Tax is completely unconstitutional as
                            it is a direct unapportioned tax. All direct taxes have to be apportioned
                            to be legal, based on the Constitution. Secondly, the required number of
                            states in order to ratify the amendment to allow the Income Tax was never
                            met. And this has even been sided in modern court cases. </P>
                        <P>�If you� examined [the 16th amendment] carefully, you would find that a
                            sufficient number of states never ratified that amendment.�<BR>-U.S.

                        <P>Third, at the present day roughly 35% of the average worker's income is
                            taken from them via this tax. That means you work 4 months out of the year
                            to refill this tax obligation. And guess where that money goes? It goes to
                            pay the interest on the currency being produced by the fraudulent Federal
                            Reserve Bank, a system that does not have to exist at all. The money you
                            make working 4 months out of the year goes almost literally into the
                            pockets of the international bankers who own the private Federal Reserve
                            Bank. And forth, even with the fraudulent Government claim as to the
                            legality of the Income Tax there is literally no statute, no law in
                            existence that requires you to pay this tax. Period.</P>
                        <P>�I really expected that, of course there is a law that you can point to
                            in the law book, a code that requires you to file a tax return. Of course
                            there is! I was at that point where I couldn't find a statute that clearly
                            made me personally liable, at least not me and the most people I know and
                            I had no choice in my mind except to resign.� �Joe Turner, Former IRS
                            Agent</P>
                        <P>�Based on the resource that I did throughout the year 2000 and that I'm
                            still doing I have not found that law. I've asked the Congress, we've
                            asked a lot of people, in the IRS, IRS Commissioner's helpers, they can't
                            answer because if they answer the American people are gonna know that this
                            whole thing is a fraud.� �Sherry Jackson, Former IRS Agent</P>
                        <P>�I haven't filed a thorough income tax return since I left.�</P>
                        <P>�I have not filed a tax return since 1999.�</P>
                        <P>The income tax is nothing less than the enslavement of the entire
                            country. Now, the control of the economy and the perpetual robbery of
                            wealth is only one side of the Rubik's cube that bankers hold in their
                            hands. The next tool for profit and control is war. Since the inception of
                            Federal Reserve in 1913 a number of large and small wars have commenced,
                            With the three most pronounced - the World War I, World War II and
                            Vietnam.</P>
                        <P></P>
                        <P>World War I</P>
                        <P>In 1914 European war broke out centered around England and Germany. The
                            American public wanted nothing to do with the war. In turn President
                            Woodrow Wilson publicly declared neutrality. However, under the surface
                            the US administration was looking for any excuse it could find to enter.
                            In another observation by the Secretary of State, William Jennings:</P>
                        <P>�The large banking interests were deeply interested in the world war
                            because of the wide opportunities for large profits.� �William Jennings
                            Bryan</P>
                        <P>It's important to understand that the most lucrative thing that can
                            happen for the international bankers is war. For, it forces the country to
                            borrow even more money from the Federal Reserve Bank at interest. Woodrow
                            Wilson's top adviser and mentor was Colonel Edward House, the man with the
                            intimate connections with the international bankers who wanted in the war.
                            In the documented conversation between Colonel House, Wilson's adviser and
                            Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary of England regarding how to get
                            America into the war, Grey inquired:</P>
                        <P>�What will American do if germans sink an ocean liner with American
                            passengers on board?�</P>
                        <P>House responded:</P>
                        <P>�I believe that a flame of indignation would sweep the United States
                            and that by itself would be sufficient to carry us into war.�</P>
                        <P>So, on May 7th 1915 on essentially the suggestion of Sir Edward Grey,
                            the ship called the Lusitania was deliberately sent into German controlled
                            waters where German military vessels were known to be. And as expected,
                            German U-boats torpedoed the ship, exploding stored ammunition, killing
                            1.200 people.<BR>To further understand the deliberate nature of this set
                            up: the German embassy actually put advertisements in the New York Times
                            telling people that if they board the Lusitania they did so at their own
                            risk as such a ship sailing from America to England through the war zone
                            would be liable to destruction. In turn, and as anticipated, the sinking
                            of the Lusitania caused a wave of anger among the American population. And
                            America entered the war a short time after. The First World War cost
                            323.000 American deaths. J.D.Rockefeller made 200 million dollars off of
                            it. That's about 1.9 trillion by today's standards. Not to mention the war
                            cost about 30 billion dollars for America. Most of which was borrowed from
                            the Federal Reserve Bank at interest furthering the profits of the
                            international bankers.</P>
                        <P><BR>World War II</P>
                        <P>On December 7th, 1941 Japan attacked the American fleet at Pearl Harbor
                            triggering our entry into that war. President Franklin D. Roosevelt
                            declared the attack was "a day that will live in infamy". A day of infamy
                            indeed, but not because of the alleged surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.
                            After 60 years of surfacing information it is clear that not only was the
                            attack on Pearl Harbor known weeks in advance, it was outright wanted and
                            provoked. Roosevelt, whose family had been New York bankers since the 18th
                            century, whose uncle Frederick was on the original Federal Reserve Board
                            was very sympathetic to the interest of the international bankers, and the
                            interest was to enter the war because as we've seen - nothing is more
                            profitable for the international bankers than war. In a journal entry by
                            Roosevelt's Secretary of War Henry Stimson dated November 25, 1941 he
                            documented a conversation he had with Roosevelt.</P>
                        <P>�The question was how should we maneuver them into firing the first
                            shot� It was desirable to make sure the Japanese be the ones to do this so
                            that there should remain no doubt as to who were the aggressors.� �Henry
                            Stimson, Secretary of War</P>
                        <P>In the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt had
                            done almost everything in his power to anger the Japanese showing the
                            posture of aggression: he halted all of Japan's imports with American
                            petroleum, he froze all of Japanese assets in the United States, He made
                            public loans to Nationalist China and supplied military aid to the
                            British, both enemies of Japan in the war, which by the way is completely
                            in violation of international war rules. And on December 4th, three days
                            before the attack, Australian intelligence told Roosevelt about a Japanese
                            task force moving towards Pearl Harbor. Roosevelt ignored it. So as hoped
                            and allowed, on December 7th, 1941 Japan attacked Pearl Harbor killing
                            2.400 soldiers. Before Pearl Harbor 83% of the American public wanted
                            nothing to do with the war. After Pearl Harbor - one million men
                            volunteered for the war.</P>
                        <P>It is important to know, Nazi Germany's war effort was largely
                            supported by two organizations: one of which was called I.G.Farben.
                            I.G.Farben produced 84% of Germany's explosives and even the Zyklon B used
                            in concentration camps to kill millions. One of the unspoken partners of
                            I.G.Farben was J.D.Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company in America. In fact,
                            the German Air Force could not operate without a special additive patented
                            by Rockefeller's Standard Oil. The drastic bombing of London by Nazi
                            Germany, for example, was made possible by a $20 million sale of fuel to
                            I.G.Farben by the Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company. This is just one
                            small point of the topic how American business funded both sides of World
                            War II.</P>
                        <P>One other treasonous organization worth mentioning is the Union Banking
                            Corporation of New York City. Not only did they financed numerous aspects
                            of Hitler's rise to power along with actual materials during the war, it
                            was also a Nazi money-laundering bank which was eventually exposed for
                            having millions of dollars of Nazi money in its vaults.</P>
                        <P>The Union Banking Corporation of New York was eventually seized for
                            violations of the Trading with the enemy Act. Guess who the director and
                            vice president of the Union Bank was? Prescott Bush, our current
                            president's grandfather and of course our former president's father. Keep
                            that in mind when considering the moral and political dispositions of the
                            Bush family.</P>
                        <P>Vietnam War</P>
                        <P>The United States official declaration of war with Vietnam in 1964 came
                            after an alleged incident involving two US destroyers being attacked by
                            the North Vietnamese PT boats in the Gulf of Tonkin. This was known as the
                            Gulf of Tonkin Incident. This single situation was the catalystic pretext
                            for massive troop deployment and full-fleshed warfare. One problem,
                            however. The attack on the US destroyers by Vietnamese PT boats never
                            happened. It was a completely staged event to have an excuse to enter the
                            war. Former Secretary of Defence Robert McNamara stated years later that
                            the Gulf of Tonkin Incident was a mistake, while many other insiders and
                            officers have come forward relaying that it was a contrived farce and
                            complete lie.</P>
                        <P>Once in the war, it was business as usual. In October 1966 President
                            Lyndon Johnson lifted trade restrictions on the Soviet block knowing full
                            well that the Soviets were providing upwards of 80% of North Vietnam war
                            supplies. Consequently, the Rockefeller interests financed factories in
                            Soviet Union which the Soviets used to manufacture military equipment and
                            send it to North Vietnam.</P>
                        <P>However, the funding of both sides in this conflict was only one side
                            of the coin. In 1985 Vietnam's Rules of Engagement were declassified. This
                            detailed what American troops were and were not allowed to do in the war.
                            It included absurdities like:</P>
                        <P>* North Vietnamese anti-aircraft missile systems could not be bombed
                            until they were known to be operational<BR>* No enemy could be pursued
                            once they crossed the border of Laos or Cambodia. And most revealing of
                            all..<BR>* The most critical strategic targets were not allowed to be
                            attacked unless initiated via high military officials. </P>
                        <P>Apart from these imposed ludicrous limitations North Vietnam was
                            informed of these restrictions and therefore could based entire strategies
                            around the limitations of the American forces. This is why the war went on
                            so long. And the bottom line is this: the Vietnam War was never meant to
                            be won. Just sustained. This war for profit resulted in 58.000 American
                            deaths and 3 million dead Vietnamese. So, where are we now?</P>
                        <P>September 11th was the jump start for, what is now, accelerating agenda
                            by the ruthless elite. It was a staged war pretext, no different than the
                            sinking of the Lusitania, the provoking of Pearl Harbor and the Gulf of
                            Tonkin lie. In fact, if 9/11 wasn't a planned war pretext, it would be an
                            exception to the rule. It has been used to launch two unprovoked illegal
                            wars, one against Iraq and one against Afghanistan. However, 9/11 was a
                            pretext for another war as well. The war against you. The Patriot Act,
                            Homeland Security, the Military Tribunals Act and other legislations are
                            all completely and entirely designed to destroy your civil liberties and

                            let's recognize how history repeats itself. In February 1933, Hitler
                            staged a false flag attack burning down his own German Parliament
                            building, the Reichstag and blamed it on communist terrorists. Within the
                            next few weeks he passed the Enabling Act which completely eradicated the
                            German Constitution, destroying people's liberties. He then led a series
                            of pre-emptive wars all justified in German people as necessary to
                            maintaining "homeland security".</P>
                        <P>�An evil exists that threatens every man, woman and child of this great
                            nation, we must take steps to ensure our domestic security and protect our
                            homeland.�<BR>-Adolf Hitler, when announcing the Gestapo to the
                            people.</P>
                        <P>�On the matter of communism and its front organizations should not
                            obscure the issue!�<BR>�Adolf Hitler</P>
                        <P>�Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that
                            supports them.�<BR>- George W. Bush</P>
                        <P>It's time to wake up. The people in power go out of their way to make
                            sure that you are perpetually misled and manipulated. The majority's
                            perception of reality, especially in the political arena, is not their
                            own. It's shrewdly imposed upon them without them even knowing it. For
                            example, the public at large actually believes the invasion of Iraq is
                            going badly as sectarian violence doesn't seem to stop. What the public
                            fails to see is that the destabilization of Iraq is exactly what the
                            people behind the government want. This war is to be sustained so the
                            region can be divided up, domination of the oil maintained, continual
                            profits reaped for the defence contractors and most importantly, permanent
                            military bases established to be used as a launching pad against other
                            oil-bearing nonconforming countries such as Iran and Syria. For further
                            implication that the civil war and estabilization is purely intentional,
                            in 2005 two elite British SAS officers were arrested by Iraqi police after
                            being caught driving around in their car, shooting at civilians while
                            dressed up as Arabs. After being arrested and taken to a jail in Basra,
                            the British Army immediately requested the release of these men. When the
                            Basra Government refused, British tanks came in and physically broke out
                            the men from the Basra prison.</P>
                        <P>�If you wish to destroy an area, how do you do it? Well there are two
                            ways: you can go in there and bomb it and so forth, but that is not very
                            efficient. What you do is you try to get the people in that area to kill
                            each other and to destroy their own territory, their own farms, and that's
                            what's been done to that area. So, the way in which you destroy the bond
                            is get him to destroy himself by dividing his ranks against one
                            another.�</P>
                        <P>�And then you feed both sides, you have agents feeding both sides -
                            inflaming both sides, and they kill each other off. And it's time that
                            some of us woke up to this reality, to understand that will people try to
                            maintain empires and create empires. They do it by manipulating the people

                            saturated with mass media entertainment from all sides while the
                            educational system in America continues its stupefying downwards slide
                            since the US Government decided to take over and subsidize the public
                            school system.</P>
                        <P>�What your government pays for, it gets. When we understand that, then
                            we look at government financed institutions of education and see the kind
                            of students and the kind of education that's been turned out by these
                            government financed schools, the logic will tell you that if what has been
                            turned out in those schools was not in accord with what the state and the
                            federal government wanted then it would change it.�</P>
                        <P>�The bottom line is that the government is getting what they have
                            ordered. They do not want your children to be educated. They do not want
                            you to think too much. That is why our country and our world has become so
                            proliferated with entertainments, mass media, television shows, amusement
                            parks, drugs, alcohol and every kind of entertainment that keep the human
                            mind entertained. So that you don't get in the way of important people by
                            doing too much thinking. You had better wake up and understand that there
                            are people who are guiding your life and you don't even know it.�</P>

                        <P>One bank, one army, one centre of power. And if we have learned
                            anything from history it is that power corrupts. And absolute power
                            corrupts absolutely.</P>
                        <P>*This is Aaron Russo, a film maker and a formal politician. To his left
                            is Nicholas Rockefeller of the infamous Rockefeller banking and business
                            dynasty. After maintaining the close friendship with Nicholas Rockefeller
                            Aaron eventually ended the relationship appalled by what he had learned
                            about the Rockefellers and their ambitions.</P>
                        <P>Aaron conversation with Nicholas :</P>
                        <P>�I got a call one day from the Terry woman I knew and she said, "Would
                            you like to meet one of the Rockefellers?" I said, "Sure, I'd love to!"
                            And we became friends. And he began to devote a lot of things to me.�</P>
                        <P>So he said to me one night, "There's gonna be an event, Aaron. And out
                            of that event you're gonna see we are going to go into Afghanistan so we
                            can run the pipelines from the Caspian Sea, we are going to go into Iraq
                            to take the oil and establish a base in the Middle-East, and then we are
                            going to go into Venezuela and try to get rid off that Chavez." And the
                            first two they've accomplished, Chavez they didn't accomplish. And so
                            you're gonna see guys going into caves, looking for people they never
                            gonna find. You know, he's laughing about the fact that you have this war
                            on terror and there's no real enemy. He's talking about how by having this
                            war on terror you can never win it 'cause it's an eternal war, so you can
                            always keep taking people's liberties away.</P>
                        <P>I said, "How you're gonna convinced people that this war is real?"</P>
                        <P>He said, "By the media. The media can convince everybody it's real. You
                            know, it's just that you keep talking about things, you keep saying it
                            over and over and over again and eventually people believe this." You know
                            they've created Federal Reserve in 1913 through lies, they've created 9/11
                            which is another lie, through 9/11 you're then fighting the war on terror
                            and afterwards you're going to Iraq which was another lie. and then they
                            gonna do Iran. And it's all one thing leading to another, leading to
                            another, leading to another.</P>
                        <P>And I would say, "what are you doing this for? What's the point of this
                            thing? You have all the money in the world you'd ever want, you have all
                            the power." I said, "You know, you're hurting people, it's not a good
                            thing."</P>
                        <P>And he would say, "What do you care about the people for? Take care of
                            yourself, and take care of your family."</P>
                        <P>And then I said to him, "What are the ultimate goals here?"</P>
                        <P>He said, "The ultimate goal is to get everybody in this world chipped
                            with an RFID chip." And to have all the money to be on those chips, and
                            everything on those chips. And if anybody wants to protest what we do or
                            violate what we want, we just turn off their chip."</P>
                        <P>That's right. Microchipped. In 2005 Congress under the pretense of
                            immigration control and the so-called "War on Terrorism" passed the Real
                            ID Act, under which, it is projected, by May 2008 you will be required to
                            carry around a federal identification card which includes on it a
                            scannable bar code with your personal information. However, this bar code
                            is only an intermediary step before the card is equipped with that very
                            chip, RFID tracking module which will use radio frequencies to track your
                            every move on the planet. If this sounds foreign to you, please know that
                            the RFID tracking chip is already in all new American passports. And the
                            final step is the implanted chip which many people had already been
                            manipulated into excepting under different pretenses.</P>
                        <P>�We have a Florida family who are really pioneers in the brave new
                            world. They have volunteered to be the first ever to have microchipped
                            identification devices implanted into their bodies.�</P>
                        <P>�After 9/11 I was really concerned about the security of my
                            family.�</P>
                        <P>�I wouldn't mind having something planted permanently in my arm that
                            would identify me.�</P>
                        <P>In the end everybody will be locked into a monetary control grip where
                            every single action you perform is documented. And if you get out of line,
                            they can just turn off your chip for at that point of time every single
                            aspect of society will revolve around interactions with the chips. This is
                            the picture that is painted for the future if you open your eyes to see
                            it. A centralized one world economy where everyone's moves and everyone's
                            transactions are tracked and monitored, all rights removed.<BR>The most
                            incredible aspect of all: these totalitarian elements will not be forced
                            upon the people, the people will demand them. For, the social manipulation
                            of society through the generation of fear and division has completely
                            detached humans from their sense of power and reality. The process which
                            has been going on for centuries, if not millennia, religion, patriotism,
                            race, wealth, class and every other form of arbitrary separatist
                            identification thus conceived has served to create a controlled population
                            utterly malleable in the hands of the few. Divide and conquer is the
                            motto. And as long as people continue to see themselves as separate from
                            everything else they lend themselves to be completely enslaved.<BR>The men
                            behind the curtain know this and they also know that if people ever
                            realized the truth of their relationship to nature and the truth of their
                            personal power, the entire manufactured zeitgeist they prey upon would
                            collapse like a house of cards.</P>
                        <P>�The whole system that we live in drills into us that we're powerless,
                            that we're weak, that our society is evil, that it's fraudulent et cetera
                            and so forth it�s all a big fat lie. We are powerful, beautiful,
                            extraordinary. There is no reason why you cannot understand who we truly
                            are, where are we going. There is no reason why the average individual
                            cannot be fully empowered. We are incredibly powerful beings.�</P>
                        <P>�I think I've spent 30 years of my life, the first 30, trying to become
                            something. I wanted to become good at things, I wanted to become good at
                            tennis, I wanted to become good at school and grades... and everything I
                            kind of viewed in that perspective: I'm not OK the way I am, but if I got
                            good at things...</P>
                        <P>...and I realized that I had the game wrong. The game was to find out
                            what I already was.�</P>
                        <P>�Now, in our culture we've been trained for individual differences to
                            stand out. So, you look at each person and immediately it is brighter,
                            dumber, older, younger, richer, poorer... and we make all these
                            dimensional distinctions, we put them in categories and treat them that
                            way. And we get so that we only see others as separate from ourselves in
                            the ways in which they're separate. And one of the dramatic
                            characteristics of experience is being with another person and suddenly
                            seeing the ways in which they're like you, and not different from you, and
                            experiencing the fact that which is essence in you, which is essence in me
                            is the one, the understanding there is no other. It is all one.�</P>
                        <P>�And I wasn't born Richard Albert, I was just born as a human being and
                            then I learned this whole business of who I am, and whether I'm good or
                            bad or achieving or not, all that's learned along the way.�</P>
                        <P>�The old appeals to racial, sexual and religious chauvinism, to rabid
                            nationalist fervour are beginning not to work. A new consciousness is
                            developing which sees the Earth as a single organism and recognizes that
                            an organism at war with itself is doomed.� � Carl Sagan, Physicist</P>
                        <P></P>
                        <P>Bill Hicks used to finish his shows with this:<BR>Life's like a ride in
                            an amusement park. We go on it and think it's real 'cause that's how
                            powerful our minds are. And the ride goes up and down and round and round.
                            It has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored and it's very
                            loud and it's fun, for a while. Some have been on the ride for a long time
                            and they begin to question, is this real, or is this just a ride? And
                            other people have remembered, and they come back to us, they say, "Hey,
                            don't worry, don't be afraid, ever, because, this is just a ride..." And
                            we kill those people. "Shut him up. I've got a lot invested in this ride.
                            Shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry. Look at my big bank account and
                            my family. This has to be real." It's just a ride. But we always kill
                            those good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? We let the
                            demons run amok. But it doesn't matter because, it's just a ride. And we
                            can change it anytime we want. It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no
                            job, no savings and money. Just a choice, right now, between fear and
                            love. </P>
